# flutter_mobile_engineer

Mobile Android Engineer Coding Challenge.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

## Stack used

Request Api -> HTTP.client
Software architectures -> MVC
State Management -> GetX
Dependency Injection via Bindings
Unit Tests (Repository)
Integration test

The purpose of this repository was to show the integration tests of the challenge. 
Getx and MVC were chosen because they are easy and quick to implement, 
despite not being recommended for use in large apps. As a way to improve this test, 
it would be possible to replace MVC with Clean architectures and GetX with BLoc/Provider, 
which would need a little more time.

I am grateful for the opportunity to showcase my skills.
